Our initial query ranking was a simple boolean comparison. It returned all pages that contained all the query tokens. Next, for milestone 3 we implemented a simple TF-IDF, without consideration of importance weighting for tokens that appeared in titles or headings. 
We then implemented a simple importance weighting system that simply added more tokens for words that appeared in headings and titles. For instance if a token appeared in a title 2 tokens would be appended to the token list. We then implemented a more sophisticated importance weighting scheme. We added a weight score to the posting. The weight score is calculated by adding a 1.0 for title tokens 0.75 for header tokens and 0.5 for bold/strong tokens. Next, we implemented the bm25 ranking algorithm which allows more control in weighting token frequency and document length. Finally, we added pagerank to score the pages based on their connectedness by links.
